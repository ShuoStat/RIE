Description: The relative information error is proposed to estimate the
    false selection in simulation study. It is alike error rate, but takes
    correlations into account. The package provides two solutions to
    calculate entropy information: the first one is based on the
    distribution (differential entropy) and can only be used for
    continuous variables, the second one is based on the discretized data
    and can be applied in both continuous and binary variables.
